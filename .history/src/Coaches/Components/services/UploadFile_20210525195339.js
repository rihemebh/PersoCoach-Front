import http from "../http-common";

class UploadFilesService {
  upload(file, onUploadProgress) {
    let formData = new FormData();

    formData.append("file", file);

    return http.post("/upload", formData, {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
      },
      onUploadProgress,
    });
  }

  getFiles() {
    return http.get("/files");
  }
}

export default new UploadFilesService();
‚Äì First we import Axios as http from http-common.js.

‚Äì Inside upload() method, we use FormData to store key-value pairs. It helps to build an object which corresponds to HTML form using append() method.

‚Äì We pass onUploadProgress to exposes progress events. This progress event are expensive (change detection for each event), so you should only use when you want to monitor it.

‚Äì We call Axios post() to send an HTTP POST for uploading a File to Rest APIs Server and get() method for HTTP GET request to retrieve all stored files.

Create Component for Upload Files
Let‚Äôs create a File Upload UI with Progress Bar, Card, Button and Message.

First we create a React component template and import UploadFilesService:

components/upload-files.component.js

import React, { Component } from "react";
import UploadService from "../services/upload-files.service";

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  constructor(props) {

  }

  render() {

  }
}
Then we define the state inside constructor() method:

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    ...

    this.state = {
      selectedFiles: undefined,
      currentFile: undefined,
      progress: 0,
      message: "",

      fileInfos: [],
    };
  }
}
Next we define selectFile() method which helps us to get the selected Files from <input type="file" > element later.

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  ...
  selectFile(event) {
    this.setState({
      selectedFiles: event.target.files,
    });
  }
We use selectedFiles for accessing current File as the first Item. Then we call UploadService.upload() method on the currentFile with a callback. So create following upload() method:

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  ...
  upload() {
    let currentFile = this.state.selectedFiles[0];

    this.setState({
      progress: 0,
      currentFile: currentFile,
    });

    UploadService.upload(currentFile, (event) => {
      this.setState({
        progress: Math.round((100 * event.loaded) / event.total),
      });
    })
      .then((response) => {
        this.setState({
          message: response.data.message,
        });
        return UploadService.getFiles();
      })
      .then((files) => {
        this.setState({
          fileInfos: files.data,
        });
      })
      .catch(() => {
        this.setState({
          progress: 0,
          message: "Could not upload the file!",
          currentFile: undefined,
        });
      });

    this.setState({
      selectedFiles: undefined,
    });
  }
The progress will be calculated basing on event.loaded and event.total.
If the transmission is done, we call UploadService.getFiles() to get the files‚Äô information and assign the result to fileInfos state, which is an array of {name, url} objects.

We also need to do this work in componentDidMount() method:

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  ...
  componentDidMount() {
    UploadService.getFiles().then((response) => {
      this.setState({
        fileInfos: response.data,
      });
    });
  }
Now we implement the render function of the Upload File UI. Add the following code inside render():

export default class UploadFiles extends Component {
  ...
  render() {
    const {
      selectedFiles,
      currentFile,
      progress,
      message,
      fileInfos,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        {currentFile && (
          <div className="progress">
            <div
              className="progress-bar progress-bar-info progress-bar-striped"
              role="progressbar"
              aria-valuenow={progress}
              aria-valuemin="0"
              aria-valuemax="100"
              style={{ width: progress + "%" }}
            >
              {progress}%
            </div>
          </div>
        )}

        <label className="btn btn-default">
          <input type="file" onChange={this.selectFile} />
        </label>

        <button className="btn btn-success"
          disabled={!selectedFiles}
          onClick={this.upload}
        >
          Upload
        </button>

        <div className="alert alert-light" role="alert">
          {message}
        </div>

        <div className="card">
          <div className="card-header">List of Files</div>
          <ul className="list-group list-group-flush">
            {fileInfos &&
              fileInfos.map((file, index) => (
                <li className="list-group-item" key={index}>
                  <a href={file.url}>{file.name}</a>
                </li>
              ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
In the code above, we use Bootstrap Progress Bar:

.progress as a wrapper
inner .progress-bar to indicate the progress
.progress-bar requires style to set the width by percentage
.progress-bar also requires role and some aria attributes to make it accessible
label of the progress bar is the text within it
To display List of uploaded files, we iterate over fileInfos array using map() function. On each file item, we use file.url as href attribute and file.name for showing text.

Add File Upload Component to App Component
Open App.js, import and embed the UploadFiles Component tag.

import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

import UploadFiles from "./components/upload-files.component";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container" style={{ width: "600px" }}>
      <div style={{ margin: "20px" }}>
        <h3>bezkoder.com</h3>
        <h4>React upload Files</h4>
      </div>

      <UploadFiles />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Configure Port for React File Upload App
Because most of HTTP Server use CORS configuration that accepts resource sharing retricted to some sites or ports, and if you use the Project in this post for making Server, you need to configure port for our App.

In project folder, create .env file with following content:

PORT=8081
So our app will run at port 8081.

Run the App
Run Spring Boot Server with command: mvn spring-boot:run.
Refresh the project directory and you will see uploads folder inside it.

Run this React File Upload Axios: npm start.
Open Browser with url http://localhost:8081/ and check the result.

Hi, in the React render() method, you can see this:

<a href={file.url}>{file.name}</a>
